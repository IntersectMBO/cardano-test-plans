# CIP-1694 User Stories and Test Scenarios Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the CIP-1694 User Stories and Test Scenarios repository! This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of user stories and corresponding test scenarios for the 
Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) 1694. These user stories and test scenarios are designed to ensure the proper implementation and functionality of the proposed changes outlined in CIP-1694.

## Introduction

The CIP-1694 User Stories and Test Scenarios repository serve as a central resource for defining and testing the features proposed in CIP-1694. The user stories provide a narrative 
description of different user interactions, while the test scenarios outline specific conditions and expected outcomes to verify the correct implementation of these features.

## User Stories

The [*user stories*](docs) in this repository are organized to reflect the various aspects of CIP-1694. Each user story is crafted to capture the perspective of different 
stakeholders and their interactions with the proposed changes. Developers, node operators, and end-users will find these user stories valuable in understanding the impact of CIP-1694 on their respective roles.

## Test Scenarios

The test scenarios complement the user stories by providing detailed steps and conditions for testing the functionality introduced by CIP-1694. These scenarios cover a range of use cases 
and edge cases to ensure robust testing. Each scenario is designed to be executable, making it easier for developers and testers to validate the correct implementation of CIP-1694.
