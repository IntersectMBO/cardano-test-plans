## User Stories

| User Story Id | Description | User Story | Component |
|---------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| CIP.001 | Constitution | As an stake holder I want a Cardano Constitution, capturing the core values and principles so that governance bodies can contrast governance actions it to decide whether it s in line with the community values and principles | Off-chain |
| CIP.002 | Hash value of the off-chain Constitution is recorded on-chain | As an Stake holder , I want the ledger to maintain a record the hash value of the current constitution together with a url hosting the off-chain document, so that I can verify the authenticity of the  off-chain document. | Node |
| CIP.003 | Node records Committee member key hashes, terms and status | As an Stake holder, I want the key hash of active and expired Committee Members and their terms to be registered on-chain so that the system can count their votes. | Node |
| CIP.004 | Authorization Certificate | As a Committee Member, I want to generate and submit a Cold to Hot Credential Authorization certificate so that I can sign votes using the hot credential and keep the cold credential in safe storage. | Node / CLI | 
| CIP.005 | Record cold credentials and authorization certificates on chain | As a committee member, I want the ledger to accurately maintain the record of key-hashes, terms, and cold to hot credentials authorization maps for active and expired members so that only votes from active Committee members count. | Node |
| CIP.006 | Replacing the constitutional committee via a governance action | As a Governance actor, I want to to submit a governance action to replace all or part of the current constitutional committee so that committee members that have lost confidence of Stake holders can be removed from their role | Node/CLI/Govtool | 
| CIP.007 | Size of the constitutional committee | As a Stake holder, I want the minimal size of the constitutional committee to be a protocol parameter so that It can be adjusted via a governance action. | Node/CLI/Govtool  |
| CIP.008 | Committee voting threshold (quorum) can be modified | As an Stake holder, I want the committee quorum (the fraction of committee required to ratify a gov action) to be not-fixed so that It can be modified via a governance action. | Node/CLI/Govtool  |
| CIP.009 | Electing an empty committee | As an Stake holder, I want to have the option of electing an empty committee so that governance actions don’t need the votes of a constitutional committee to be ratified. | Node |
| CIP.010 | Constitutional committee members have a limited term | As a Stake holder and as a committee member, I want each committee member to have an individual term so that the system can have a rotation scheme. | Node |
| CIP.010 | Tracking committee member expirations | As a Stake holder, I want the system to keep track of the expiration epoch of each committee member so that the information is publicly available in the ledger and the community can plan ahead and agree on new CC member | Node |
| CIP.011 | Automatically expire committee members that have completed their terms | As an stake holder and as committee member, I want the system to automatically expire committee members that have reached their term so that only votes from active committee members count towards ratification. | Node |
| CIP.012 | Resign as committee member | As a committee member, I want to be able to resign my responsibilities with the Cardano Community while minimizing the effects on the system. | Node / CLI |
| CIP.013 | State of no-confidence | As a stake holder, I want to submit a governance action to depose the current constitutional committee and put the system in a no-confidence-state so that the community must elect a new constitutional committee. | Node / CLI / GovTool |
| CIP.014 | Constitutional Committee below committeeMinSize | As a stake holder, I want that when the number of non-expired committee members falls below the minimal size of the committee, only update-committee and no-confidence governance actions can be ratified. | Node |
| CIP.015 | Proposal policy | As a stake holder, I want the option for the constitution to be accompanied by a script so that governance actions proposing parameter changes or treasury withdrawals that violate accepted limits are automatically restricted. | Node |
| CIP.016 | Delegate votes to a registered Delegate Representatives | As a stake holder, I want to delegate voting rights to a registered delegate representative (DRep) so that I can participate in the governance of the system backing up votes with my stake | Node / CLI / GovTool |
| CIP.017 | Delegate to always abstain | As a stake holder, I want to delegate my stake to the predefined option 'Abstain' so that my stake is marked as not participating in governance. | Node / CLI / GovTool / cardano-wallet |
| CIP.018 | Delegate to no-confidence | As a stake holder, I want to delegate my stake to the predefined DRep 'No Confidence' so that my stake is counted as a 'Yes' vote on every 'No Confidence' action and a 'No' vote on every other action. | Node / CLI / GovTool / cardano-wallet |
| CIP.019 | Inactive DReps | As an Ada holder, I want DReps to be considered inactive if they don’t vote for `drepActivity`-many epochs so that their delegated stake does not count towards the active voting stake, this to avoid leaving the system in a state where no governance action can pass. | Node |
| CIP.020 | DRep credentials | As a DRep, I want to be identified by a credential that can be a verification key (Ed2559) or a Native or Plutus Script, so that I can register and vote on governance actions with a signing key or with the evaluation of a script logic. | Node |
| CIP.021 | DRep registration certificate | As a DRep, I want to generate and submit a registration certificate so that the system recognizes my credentials and counts my votes on governance actions proportionally to the voting stake delegated to me | Node / CLI / GovTool |
| CIP.022 | Vote delegation certificate | As an stake holder, I want to generate and vote delegation certificate so that I can delegate my voting rights to a default or registered DRep. | Node / CLI / GovTool / cardano-wallet |
| CIP.023 | DRep retirement certificate | As a DRep, I want to generate and submit a retirement certificate so that the system and stake holders know that I’m no longer voting on governance actions and they stake holders should re-delegate.  | Node / CLI / GovTool |
| CIP.024 | DRep retirement certificate is applied immediately after being accepted on-chain | As a DRep I want my retirement certificate to be applied immediately when it is accepted on chain and the DRep deposit is returned as part of the same transaction so that there is no waiting time | Node / CLI / GovTool |
| CIP.025 | per-DRep stake distribution | As an ada holder I want the system to calculate the stake distribution per-DRep so that each DRep vote weights for as many votes as its actual stake delegated to them. Per-DRep stake distribution uses the stake snapshot of the last epoch boundary | Node |
| CIP.027 | Bootstrapping phase | Please refer to [Bootstrapping phase ](./08-bootstrapping-phase.md)| - |
| CIP.028 | Blocking rewards withdrawal | As a stake holder I want that when bootstrapping phase ends, the system blocks rewards withdrawals for stake credentials that are not delegating to a DRep.  | Node |

| CIP.030 | Governance action initiation | As an stake holder I want that any stake holder can submit a governance action so that there are not restrictions about who can initiate an update on the system beyond the requirements for a valid transaction of this type. | Node/CLI/GovTool |
| CIP.031 | Governance actions must provide a deposit | As a stake holder I want that governance actors must provide a deposit in lovelace, which will be returned to the user once the action is ratified or expired, so that we prevent spamming the network with meaningless governance actions |  Node/CLI/GovTool | 
| CIP.032a| Contents of governance actions | As stake holder I want that every governance action must contain:<br>-a deposit amount<br>-a reward address to receive the deposit back<br>-an anchor for any metadata<br>-a hash digest value of the last enacted governance of the same type so that it can be processed by the node, accepted on-chain and put to consideration of the governance bodies | Node/CLI/GovTool |
