| CIP.002 | Node records Committee member key hashes, terms and status | As an Ada holder, I want the key hash of active and expired Committee Members and their terms to be registered on-chain so that the system can count their votes. | Node |
| CIP.003 | Authorization Certificate | As a Committee Member, I want to submit a Cold to Hot key Authorization certificate so that I can sign my votes using the hot key and keep my cold keys safely in cold storage. | Node / CLI |
| CIP.003 | Record cold credentials and authorization certificates on chain | As a committee member, I want node’s ledger state to accurately maintain the record of key-hashes, terms, and cold to hot key authorization maps for active and expired members so that only votes from active Committee members are considered. | Node |

| CIP.018 | Inactive DReps | As an Ada holder, I want DReps to be considered inactive if they don’t vote for `drepActivity`-many epochs so that their delegated stake does not count towards the active voting stake, this to avoid leaving the system in a state where no governance action can pass. | Node |
