| User Story Id | Title | User Story | Component |
|---------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| CIP.001 | Hash value of the off-chain Constitution is recorded on-chain | As an Ada holder, I want the ledger state to record the hash of the current constitution so that I can verify the authenticity of the  off-chain document. | Node |
| CIP.002 | Node records Committee member key hashes, terms and status | As an Ada holder, I want the key hash of active and expired Committee Members and their terms to be registered on-chain so that the system can count their votes. | Node |
| CIP.003 | Authorization Certificate | As a Committee Member, I want to submit a Cold to Hot key Authorization certificate so that I can sign my votes using the hot key and keep my cold keys safely in cold storage. | Node / CLI |
| CIP.003 | Record cold credentials and authorization certificates on chain | As a committee member, I want node’s ledger state to accurately maintain the record of key-hashes, terms, and cold to hot key authorization maps for active and expired members so that only votes from active Committee members are considered. | Node |
| CIP.004 | Replacing the constitutional committee via a governance action | As an Ada holder, I want to be able to submit a governance action to replace all or part of the current constitutional committee so that committee members that have lost confidence of Ada holders can be removed from their duties. | Node / CLI / GovTool |
| CIP.005 | Size of the constitutional committee | As an Ada holder, I want the size of the constitutional committee to be adjustable (a protocol parameter) so that I can propose a different size via a governance action. | Node |
| CIP.006 | Committee voting threshold (quorum) can be modified | As an Ada holder, I want that the committee threshold (the fraction of committee required to ratify a gov action) is not fixed so that I can propose a different threshold via a governance action. | Node |
| CIP.007 | Electing an empty committee | As an Ada holder, I want to be able to elect an empty committee if the community wishes to abolish the constitutional committee entirely so that governance actions don’t need the votes of a constitutional committee to be ratified. | Node |
| CIP.008 | Constitutional committee members have a limited term | As an Ada holder, I want each committee member to have an individual term so that the system can have a rotation scheme. | Node |
| CIP.009 | Tracking committee member expirations | As an Ada holder, I want the system to keep track of the expiration epoch of each committee member so that the information is publicly available in the ledger and can be consumed by anyone interested. | Node |
| CIP.010 | Automatically expire committee members that have completed their terms | As an Ada holder, I want the system to automatically expire committee members that have reached their term so that only active committee members can vote. | Node |
| CIP.011 | Resign as committee member | As a committee member, I want to be able to resign my responsibilities so that I can stop my responsibilities with the Cardano Community while minimizing the effects on the system. | Node / CLI |
| CIP.012 | State of no-confidence | As an Ada holder, I want to submit a governance action to depose the current constitutional committee and put the system in a no-confidence-state so that the community must elect a new constitutional committee. | Node / CLI / GovTool |
| CIP.013 | Constitutional Committee below committeeMinSize | As an Ada holder, I want that when the number of non-expired committee members falls below the minimal size of the committee, only update-committee and no-confidence governance actions can be ratified. | Node |
| CIP.014 | Proposal policy | As an Ada holder, I want a supplementary script to the constitution so that some proposal types are automatically restricted. | Node |
| CIP.015 | Delegate representatives | As an Ada holder, I want stake credentials to delegate voting rights to a registered delegate representative (DRep) so that I can participate in the governance of the system. | Node / CLI / GovTool |
| CIP.016 | Delegate to always abstain | As an Ada holder or an exchange, I want to delegate my stake to the predefined option 'Abstain' so that my stake is marked as not participating in governance. | Node / CLI / GovTool / cardano-wallet |
| CIP.017 | Delegate to no-confidence | As an Ada holder, I want to delegate my stake to the predefined DRep 'No Confidence' so that my stake is counted as a 'Yes' vote on every 'No Confidence' action and a 'No' vote on every other action. | Node / CLI / GovTool / cardano-wallet |
| CIP.018 | Inactive DReps | As an Ada holder, I want DReps to be considered inactive if they don’t vote for `drepActivity`-many epochs so that their delegated stake does not count towards the active voting stake, this to avoid leaving the system in a state where no governance action can pass. | Node |
| CIP.019 | DRep credentials | As a DRep, I want to be identified by a credential (A verification key (Ed2559) or a Native or Plutus Script) so that I can register and vote on governance actions. | Node |
| CIP.020 | DRep registration certificate | As a DRep, I want to generate a registration certificate so that the system recognizes my credentials and counts my votes on governance actions. | Node / CLI / GovTool |
| CIP.021 | Vote delegation certificate | As an Ada holder, I want to generate a vote delegation certificate so that I can delegate my voting rights. | Node / CLI / GovTool / cardano-wallet |
