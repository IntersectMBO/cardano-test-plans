## User Stories

| User Story Id | Description | User Story | Component |
|---------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| <a id="CIP001a"></a>CIP.001a | Constitution | As a Stakeholder, I want a Cardano Constitution that captures the core values and principles so that governance bodies can compare governance actions to it and decide whether it is in line with the community's values and principles. | Off-chain |
| <a id="CIP001b"></a>CIP.001b | Hash value of the off-chain Constitution is recorded on-chain | As a Stakeholder , I want the ledger to maintain a record of the hash value of the current constitution together with a URL hosting the off-chain document, so that I can verify the authenticity of the off-chain document. | Node |
| <a id="CIP002"></a>CIP.002 | Node records Committee member key hashes, terms and status | As a Stakeholder, I want the key hash of active and expired Committee Members and their terms to be registered on-chain so that the system can count their votes. | Node |
| <a id="CIP003"></a>CIP.003| Authorization Certificate | As a Committee Member, I want to generate and submit a Cold to Hot Credential Authorization certificate so that I can sign votes using the hot credential and keep the cold credential in safe storage. | Node / CLI | 
| <a id="CIP004"></a>CIP.004| Record cold credentials and authorization certificates on chain | As a committee member, I want the ledger to accurately maintain the record of key-hashes, terms, and cold to hot credentials authorization maps for active and expired members so that only votes from active Committee members count. | Node |
| <a id="CIP005"></a>CIP.005 | Replacing the Constitutional Committee via a governance action | As a Governance Actor, I want to submit a governance action to replace all or part of the current constitutional committee so that committee members who have lost the confidence of stakeholders can be removed from their role. | Node/CLI/Govtool | 
| <a id="CIP006"></a>CIP.006 | Size of the Constitutional Committee | As a Stakeholder, I want the minimal size of the Constitutional Committee to be a protocol parameter so that it can be adjusted via a governance action. | Node/CLI/Govtool  |
| <a id="CIP007"></a>CIP.007 | Committee voting threshold (quorum) can be modified | As a Stakeholder, I want the committee quorum (the fraction of committee required to ratify a gov action) to be not fixed so that it can be modified via a governance action. | Node/CLI/Govtool  |
| <a id="CIP008"></a>CIP.008 | Electing an empty committee | As a Stakeholder, I want to have the option of electing an empty committee so that governance actions don’t need the votes of a Constitutional Committee to be ratified. | Node |
| <a id="CIP009"></a>CIP.009 | Constitutional Committee members have a limited term | As a Stakeholder and as a Committee Member, I want each Committee Member to have an individual term so that the system can have a rotation scheme. | Node |
| <a id="CIP010"></a>CIP.010 | Tracking committee member expirations | As a Stakeholder, I want the system to keep track of the expiration epoch of each committee member so that the information is publicly available in the ledger and the community can plan ahead and agree on new CC member. | Node |
| <a id="CIP011"></a>CIP.011 | Automatically expire committee members that have completed their terms | As a Stakeholder and as a Committee Member, I want the system to automatically expire committee members that have reached their term so that only votes from active committee members count towards ratification. | Node |

| <a id="CIP013"></a>CIP.013 | State of no-confidence | As a Stakeholder, I want to submit a governance action to depose the current Constitutional Committee and put the system in a no-confidence state so that the community must elect a new Constitutional Committee. | Node / CLI / GovTool |
| <a id="CIP014"></a>CIP.014 | Constitutional Committee below committeeMinSize | As a Stakeholder, I want, when the number of non-expired committee members falls below the minimal size of the committee, only update-committee and no-confidence governance actions can be ratified. | Node |
| <a id="CIP015"></a>CIP.015 | Proposal policy | As a Stakeholder, I want the option for the constitution to be accompanied by a script so that governance actions proposing parameter changes or treasury withdrawals that violate accepted limits are automatically restricted. | Node |
| <a id="CIP016"></a>CIP.016 |Delegate votes to a registered Delegate Representatives | As a Stakeholder, I want to delegate voting rights to a registered Delegate Representative (DRep) so that I can participate in the governance of the system backing up votes with my stake. | Node / CLI / GovTool |
| <a id="CIP017"></a>CIP.017 | Delegate to always abstain | As a Stakeholder, I want to delegate my stake to the predefined option 'Abstain' so that my stake is marked as not participating in governance. | Node / CLI / GovTool / cardano-wallet |
| <a id="CIP018"></a>CIP.018 | Delegate to no-confidence | As a Stakeholder, I want to delegate my stake to the predefined DRep 'No Confidence' so that my stake is counted as a 'Yes' vote on every 'No Confidence' action and a 'No' vote on every other action. | Node / CLI / GovTool / cardano-wallet |
| <a id="CIP019"></a>CIP.019 | Inactive DReps | As an Ada Holder, I want DReps to be considered inactive if they don’t vote for `drepActivity`-many epochs so that their delegated stake does not count towards the active voting stake, to avoid leaving the system in a state where no governance action can pass. | Node |
| <a id="CIP020"></a>CIP.020 | DRep credentials | As a DRep, I want to be identified by a credential that can be a verification key (Ed25519) or a Native or Plutus Script, so that I can register and vote on governance actions with a signing key or with the evaluation of a script logic. | Node |
| <a id="CIP021"></a>CIP.021 | DRep registration certificate | As a DRep, I want to generate and submit a registration certificate so that the system recognizes my credentials and counts my votes on governance actions proportionally to the voting stake delegated to me. | Node / CLI / GovTool |

| <a id="CIP025"></a>CIP.025 | per-DRep stake distribution | As an Ada Holder, I want the system to calculate the stake distribution per DRep, ensuring that each DRep's vote is weighted according to the actual stake delegated to them. This per-DRep stake distribution should use the stake snapshot from the last epoch boundary. | Node |

| <a id="CIP029"></a>CIP.029 |Governance action initiation | As a Stakeholder, I want any stakeholder to be able to submit a governance action without restrictions, beyond those necessary for a transaction of this type to be considered valid. | Node/CLI/GovTool |
| <a id="CIP030"></a>CIP.030 | Governance actions must provide a deposit | As a Stakeholder, I want Governance Actors to be required to provide a deposit in lovelace.

So that I can create a governance action that aligns with the Conway CDDL  ensuring it is comprehensible and can be accurately processed by the ledger. | Node/CLI/GovTool |

| <a id="CIP032"></a>CIP.032 | As a Stakeholder, I want governance actions submitted in a transaction and admitted to the chain to remain active for up to govActionLifetime epochs. These actions should be checked for ratification at every epoch boundary within their govActionLifetime.
