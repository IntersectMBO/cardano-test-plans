## User Story ID:  CLI.001

### Title: Obtain constitution hash for verification
### User Story
- As an Ada holder,
I want to obtain the hash of the off-chain text of a Constitution
So that I can compare it against the hash registered on-chain to verify its authenticity.

### Functional requirements
- When I provide the off-chain text of the Constitution, the cardano-cli should calculate and return the corresponding blake2b-256 hash of the document.
### Acceptance Criteria
- Given that a holder provides the off-chain text of the constitution then cardano-cli should return the corresponding blake2b-256 hash. Provided that it is the same document, the resulting hash should match the one registered on-chain.
